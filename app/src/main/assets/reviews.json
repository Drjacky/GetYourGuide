Tour guide obviously well versed on Templehof and that is appreciated. I learned far more about Templehof than I ever imagined.\nIt was a challenge finding check-in location. We walked a fair distance around property before finding GAT. Maybe walking directions from the nearest U-Bahn stop.",

Once you get to the GAT door, go in and enter the first room on your left. This will have two desks and is where you sign in for the tour. You can also wait inside if you arrive to early.",

The only negative was that you barely scrape the surface of the building, considering just how many rooms it has, but naturally a tour that shows every room would be nigh on impossible. Also expect to walk lots, and there are only a couple of lifts in the building, so perhaps not the best for those who require a wheelchair, however the staff are lovely and I\u0026#039;m sure with advanced knowledge of your requirements they would be able to cater to your needs.",

We were lucky enough to have in our group a former US soldier that was stationed in Tempelhof in the last years of USA\u0026#039;s presence. He was very kind to extend the impressive guide\u0026#039;s information with first person testimonials and many interesting details.\n\nLovely afternoon spent learning about our recent history. Suggest after the tour you walk around to the landing strips that are now open to everyone as a park. Really unique place.",

      "message":"We joined the 2 hour guided tour in English, on a weekend visit to Berlin in April. I\u0026#039;d always wished I\u0026#039;d visited Tempelhof whilst it was still (kind of) operating as an airport on a previous visit in 2005, but this seemed like the next best thing. Overall we both really enjoyed the visit - the guide was excellent, he seemed to know his stuff (apparently having worked at the airport) and he went out of his way to make sure we got to at least glimpse things which were officially \u0026#039;off limits\u0026#039;. This leads on to the reason why this tour gets dropped a star - as others reviewers seem to have experienced, access was quite severely limited during our visit. Partly this was down to ongoing work on the airport which is fair enough, but the frustrating part was that access to the main booking hall and the hanger area was not permitted due to corporate events taking place. This did detract from the experience, but was redeemed to some extent by the excellent guide. Maybe next time we\u0026#039;ll see more!",

I went to the red dot on the map and there was no one there. I had to call to get further clarification, so please amend the meeting point description to reflect that you should meet across from the Esso gas station on Tempelhoff Damm where it says \u0026quot;GAT\u0026quot; in yellow on the door. In addition, the phone number on the receipt has an extra \u0026quot;030\u0026quot; in it that should be removed.\n\nWho knew there was a basketball court near the top of the building? I was disappointed that we could not go to the roof as it was under construction and that we could not see the main entrance hall as there was a party going on :-(. But other than that the tour guide knew his stuff and looking behind the scenes was fascinating and educational.\n\nI would strongly recommend this tour, but check first if there are any parties going on as if there are you can\u0026#039;t get into the main hall.",

      "message":"Die F\u00fchrung war gut besucht, wir wurden in zwei Gruppen aufgeteilt. Alles gut organisiert und man hat nix verpasst. Der Guide war freundlich und hat alle \u0026quot;abgeholt\u0026quot;, wir konnten auch eigene Fragen stellen und alles wurde beantwortet. Wenn man sich f\u00fcr Geschichte des Flugverkehrs und nat\u00fcrlich auch f\u00fcr die Architektur der 30er Jahre interessiert, dann ist das genau das richtige!",

Erst ein Blick vom Dach des Geb\u00e4udes l\u00e4sst die wahre Gr\u00f6\u00dfe erkennen, in allen Dimensionen. Hoffentlich kann der weitere Ausbau an Aktivit\u00e4ten den Flughafen weiter am Leben erhalten.",
